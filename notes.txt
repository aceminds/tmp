Code review aims to identify flaws in the application related to its features and code, along with seeking opinions from peers on alternative design choices.
There are two part - automated and manual (peer)


Currrent Process
Lack of an integrated code review process embedded into the software development and maintainance cycle
Teams have adopted inconsistent or no practices to peer review the code for style and consistency in design and implementation 
Absence of a tollgate to prevent individual developers from committing arbitrary or prototype code to the production codebase
Unavailability of an enterprise tool to make code comments, ask questions, request changes, accept the changes, and capture metrics about the review process.
Need to leapfrog code quality and maturity to the next level from static code analysis and unit text coverage compliance


Improvement Target state
Define a code review process, flow, and tollgate
Foster a culture of feedback and expert knowledge sharing that benifits entire developer community
Establish guiding controls for sharing of information across the team, c coding conventions and standards compliance, and  improving the overall process and quality of code
Develop best practices and principles in collaboration with subject matter experts and development teams across the bank.
Proatively educate and upskill developers on costly and most frequent coding and design errors 
Enterprise-wide index of cross-domain subject matter and development expertise
Provision a set of tool for collecting expert knowledge on quality improvement, defect reduction and building an experience base for developers
